// Part 1 - 
// - Open workshop/index.js in your editor and read the makeUrl definition
//      + The equal, notEqual and test functions from the Learn Testing workshop are included on the page for you to use.
// - Open workshop/index.test.js and write a test for makeUrl
// - Open workshop/index.html and check your test passes
// My Solution:
test('Testing url works', equal(makeUrl('pikachu'), "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pikachu", 'This paased'));
